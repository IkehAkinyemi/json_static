# The json_static project

If, for our program, we are sure that we know the structure of the JSON file, a statically typed technique can and should be used instead. It is shown in the json_static project. The situation here is similar to that of the projects processing the TOML file.
The source code of the static version first declares three structsâ€”one for every object type contained in the JSON file we are going to process. Each struct is preceded by the following attribute:
```
  #[derive(Deserialize, Serialize, Debug)]
```
  
### Storing and Retrieving Data

Let's understand the preceding snippet:
1. The Deserialize trait is required to parse (that is, read) JSON strings into this struct.
2. The Serialize trait is required to format (that is, write) this struct into a JSON string.
3. The Debug trait is just handy for printing this struct on a debug trace.
The JSON string is parsed using
the `serde_json::from_str::<SalesAndProducts>` function. Then, the code to increment the quantity of sold oranges becomes quite simple:
```
   sales_and_products.sales[1].quantity += 1.5
```
